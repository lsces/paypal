Package has been created to assist maintaining paypal side of commerce site.
Initial tools have been developed to pull contact information and sales 
invoices from the paypal dumps. Eventually this will be replaced with 
locally managed information, and only pushed to paypal, but for simple 
shopping sites using the basic paypal shopping basket can be linked 
using the tools provided.

Contact information is pushed to the contact package.
